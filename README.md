# todo-fire

todo-fire is a **realtime & offline-first**, todo mobile app for android and iOS built using react-native & firebase.

It syncs data in realtime across multiple devices, so you can "jump" between devices
without worrying about syncing.<br />

todo-fire is made with high availability and high consistency, It's made possible to achieve both through the underlying Spanner DB [see paper...][spanner-paper]
  
todo-fire has authentication built-in through firebase email-password method.

## Functional Requirements
1. Displays a list of tasks
2. Includes a form or input field where users can add a new task to the list
3. Each task haa a title, due_at(optional), note(optional) and status (completed or not)
4. Users should be able to mark tasks as completed or uncompleted by tapping on them
5. Users should be able to delete tasks from the list

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Highly Available - Available both online and offline (reads and writes are both supported through firestore db)
2. Highly Consistent - When online, this is acheieved by real-time syncing eliminating eventual consistency
3. Fault Tolerant - Writes are appended to firestore's commit log on disk and not lost if the app crashes or device runs out of power
